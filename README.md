# Panda-or-Bear-images-Classification-MLP-
In this project, we had to classify panda and bear images using an MLP neural network. At the client's request, we were not allowed to use TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch, and the network had to be designed using Python and the Numpy library only! The result was amazing!
